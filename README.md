# RoboCup Logistics League Referee Box ROS Integration

This package provides nodes that allow to communicate with the referee
box of the RoboCup Logistics League (https://ll.robocup.org)
through ROS2 topics (incoming information) and services (command outgoing
messages).

The package relies on the rcll-protobuf-msgs(https://github.com/robocup-logistics/rcll-protobuf-msgs) for its message types.
